### Rate Limits

Revert will return a rate limit error with the HTTP status code `429` when the request rate limit for an application or an individual IP address has been exceeded.

As a default, 4 requests per minute are allowed from a single IP address but if you're needs are higher please get in touch and we can tailor it to your use-case.
