#### Spinning up Revert with docker-compose locally

The easiest way to start with self-hosted Revert is to run it via docker-compose:

```shell
# Get the code
git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/revertinc/revert

# Copy the example env file
cd revert
cp .env.example .env
cp packages/backend/.env.example packages/backend/.env
cp packages/client/.env.example packages/client/.env
cp packages/js/.env.example packages/js/.env
cp packages/react/.env.example packages/react/.env
cp packages/vue/.env.example packages/vue/.env

# Ensure that clerk is setup in `client` and a user is created by following the instructions here: https://docs.revert.dev/overview/developer-guide/developer-guide#-revertdotdev-client

# Update these .env files with any of your own secrets if you'd like to.

# Then In the root directory run

# When running for the first time to seed the database. (RUN ONLY ONCE)
docker-compose run db-seed

# For subsequent runs
docker-compose up -d

```

The UI is now available at http://localhost:3000 and the backend is available at http://localhost:4001. This also contains a postgres database alongside the API. 


#### Run Revert with your own database & redis

The above steps allow you to spin up a postgres & redis instance alongside the API and UI. 

To use your own postgres & redis instance run the following set of commands: 


```shell

# Seed the database

docker run \ 
    -e PGSQL_URL=postgresql://<PG_USER>:<PG_PASSWORD>@<PG_HOST>:<PG_PORT>/<PG_DB> \
    revertengg/revert-db-seed:latest

# To run Revert API:

docker run \
  -v cache:/data \
  -v pgdata:/var/lib/postgresql/data \
  -e PGSQL_URL=postgresql://<PG_USER>:<PG_PASSWORD>@<PG_HOST>:<PG_PORT>/<PG_DB> \
  -e REDIS_SERVER_URL=redis://<REDIS_USER>:<REDIS_PASSWORD>@<REDIS_HOST>:<REDIS_PORT> \
  revertengg/revert-api-ce:latest

```
