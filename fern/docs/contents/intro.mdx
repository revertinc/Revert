### Welcome ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to the Revert docs! ðŸ‘‹ You will find all the documentation for our API's, SDKs and anything else you'd need to allow you to integrate a third-party API into your product.

### Integrations are harder than they seem.

Integrations require a lot more engineering time, resources, and ongoing maintenance than you would first expect.
When building your own integrations you have to deal with a lot of challenges, such as: unreliable third party integration endpoints, which fail or hang more often than you think; monitoring and reliability of the integration code; dealing with different schemas, gotchas, rate-limits of the various APIs you integrate with.
You need to do this ALL alongside maintaining your own code base.

This is where we come in. With Revert you can ship a product integration in under 60 minutes, and we take care of all of the above and more.

### Introduction

Revert is a unified API for all your product integrations.

This means you do not need to integrate with multiple third-party APIs yourself and only integrate with Revert once. New third party integrations will automatically be added and can be turned on immediately.
Your customers authenticate their tools with us using our drop-in UI that you can integrate in your front-end.
