### ‚≠ê About Revert

Revert makes it incredibly easy to build integrations with any third party API such as

-   Go-to-market tools like CRMs (Salesforce, Hubspot).
-   Communication tools (Slack, MS Teams)
-   Ticketing tools like (Jira, Asana)

> We believe an **open source unified API** enables us to cover the long tail of third party APIs while empowering engineers to customise the integration code we offer out of the box. This way engineers can use us over building everything from scratch.

## Quickstart

#### Spinning up Revert with docker-compose

The easiest way to start Revert is to run it via docker-compose:

```shell
# Get the code
git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/revertinc/revert

# Copy the example env file
cp .env.example .env
cp .env.example .env
cp packages/backend/.env.example packages/backend/.env
cp packages/client/.env.example packages/client/.env
cp packages/js/.env.example packages/js/.env
cp packages/react/.env.example packages/react/.env
cp packages/vue/.env.example packages/vue/.env

# Update these .env files with your own secrets if you'd like to.

# Then In the root directory run

# When running for the first time to seed the database. (RUN ONLY ONCE)
docker-compose run db-seed

# For subsequent runs
docker-compose up -d

```

The UI is now available at http://localhost:3000 and the backend is available at http://localhost:4001.
